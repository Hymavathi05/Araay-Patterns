# Check if Array is in Ascending Order — Java

This program checks whether a given integer array is sorted in
ascending order or not.

---

## 🟢 Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]`, determine whether the array elements are in
strict ascending order.

Example

Input  : [11, 27, 29, 31, 33]  
Output : Array is in Ascending order

Input  : [11, 27, 29, 31, 3]  
Output : Array is not in Ascending order

---

## ✅ Approach

1. Assume the array is sorted (`isSorted = true`)
2. Iterate through the array
3. Compare each element with the next element
4. If any element is greater than the next element
   - mark `isSorted = false`
   - break the loop
5. Print result based on the flag

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

arr[i] > arr[i+1] → array is not sorted

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity  : O(n)
- Space Complexity : O(1)

---

## 🧪 Test Cases Considered

- Sorted array
- Unsorted array
- Duplicate values
- Single element array

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

- Array traversal
- Conditional comparisons
- Boolean flag usage
- Early loop termination for efficiency












Array Left Rotation — Java Solutions

This repository contains two implementations of the Left Rotation of an Array problem in Java:

Iterative Single-Shift Approach (Brute Force)

Optimal Reversal Algorithm (O(n), In-Place)

Both programs rotate the array to the left by k positions.

🟢 Problem Statement

Given an array arr[] and an integer k, rotate the array to the left by k positions.

Example:

Input  : [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
Output : [3, 4, 1, 2]

✅ Solution 1 — Iterative Single-Shift (Brute Force)

File: LeftRotateArray.java

Approach

Normalize rotation count using k % n

Repeat k times:

Store arr[0] in temp

Shift elements one step left

Place temp at last index

Complexity

Time : O(k * n)

Space : O(1)

✔ Simple and readable
❌ Slower for large k

🚀 Solution 2 — Optimal Reversal Algorithm

File: OptimalSolutionOfLeftRotateArray.java

Approach (3-Step Reverse)

1️⃣ Reverse first k elements
2️⃣ Reverse remaining n-k elements
3️⃣ Reverse entire array

Complexity

Time : O(n)

Space : O(1) (in-place)

✔ Efficient for large arrays
✔ No extra memory

🧪 Test Cases Covered

k = 0

k = 1

k > n

Single-element array

Normal rotation
